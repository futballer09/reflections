When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1. When working with other developers
2. When wanting to maintain a backup in the cloud
3. When wanting to more easily share my code publicly

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?
1. You may be in the middle of editing a file and not want it overwritten
2. You may not want to pull commits from remote repository into your local at that time.
